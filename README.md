Wave Simulator
=
The idea is to provide an interactive experience constructing
or configuring waves of sound or light in an open sandbox
environment with a sleek UI.

Consider the window as being split into three parts: Tabs, UI, and Sandbox.

Each tab has their own preset bunch of UI which affects the state
of its scene.

REMEMBER WHEN DEVELOPING:

- do some water physics (something with shaders)
- do some sound physics
- ALL IS 2D
- give waves their own pipeline and shaders
(stencil for determining if can progress?)
